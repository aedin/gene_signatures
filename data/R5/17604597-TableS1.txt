One of the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of MoCo is molybdopterin synthase (MPT synthase). The protein encoded by this gene adenylates and activates MPT synthase. This gene contains no introns. A pseudogene of this gene is present on chromosome 14.	Mo-molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis - ligase activity	0.105333492	0.062762851	0.333200373	0.167098905
	H20529	Cyclin D1 (PRAD1: parathyroid adenomatosis 1)	Hs.523852	CCND1	11	11q13	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4 or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein has been shown to interact with tumor suppressor protein Rb and the expression of this gene is regulated positively by Rb. Mutations, amplification and overexpression of this gene, which alters cell cycle progression, are observed frequently in a variety of tumors and may contribute to tumorigenesis.

Once activated Raf-1 can phosphorylate to activate the dual specificity protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2 which in turn phosphorylate to activate the serine/threonine specific protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERKs are pleiotropic effectors of cell physiology and play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in the cell division cycle, apoptosis, cell differentiation and cell migration.

The mutations of this gene are associated with an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome most often accompanied by alpha-thalassemia (ATRX) syndrome. Theses mutations have been shown to cause diverse changes in the pattern of DNA methylation, which may provide a link between chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and gene expression in developmental processes. This protein is found to undergo cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation, which regulates its nuclear matrix and chromatin association, and suggests its involvement in the gene regulation at interphase and chromosomal segregation in mitosis.

	N44142	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase	Hs.643495	HMGCR	5	5q13.3-q14	HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis and is regulated via a negative feedback mechanism mediated by sterols and non-sterol metabolites derived from mevalonate, the product of the reaction catalyzed by reductase. Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is suppressed by cholesterol derived from the internalization and degradation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor.  Competitive inhibitors of the reductase induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol, an important determinant of atherosclerosis.	biosynthesis - cholesterol biosynthesis - endoplasmic reticulum membrane - germ cell migration - gonad development - hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) activity - integral to membrane - lipid metabolism - membrane fraction - oxidoreductase activity - peroxisome	0.149422191	0.17360345	0.308540777	0.210522139

	BI768209	Ankyrin 3, node of Ranvier (ankyrin G)	Hs.499725	ANK3	10	10q21	Ankyrins are a family of proteins that are believed to link the integral membrane proteins to the underlying spectrin-actin cytoskeleton and play key roles in activities such as cell motility, activation, proliferation, contact, and the maintenance of specialized membrane domains. Multiple isoforms of ankyrin with different affinities for various target proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific, developmentally regulated manner. Most ankyrins are typically composed of three structural domains: an amino-terminal domain containing multiple ankyrin repeats; a central region with a highly conserved spectrin binding domain; and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain which is the least conserved and subject to variation. Ankyrin 3 is an immunologically distinct gene product from ankyrins 1 and 2, and was originally found at the axonal initial segment and nodes of Ranvier of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Alternatively spliced variants may be expressed in other tissues. Although multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene, the full-length nature of only two have been characterized.

It has been proposed as a primary component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes. CYBB deficiency is one of five described biochemical defects associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). In this disorder, there is decreased activity of phagocyte NADPH oxidase; neutrophils are able to phagocytize bacteria but cannot kill them in the phagocytic vacuoles. The cause of the killing defect is an inability to increase the cells respiration and consequent failure to deliver activated oxygen into the phagocytic vacuole.	antimicrobial humoral response (sensu Vertebrata) - electron transport - electron transporter activity - inflammatory response - integral to membrane - membrane - mitochondrion - oxidoreductase activity - transport - voltage-gated ion channel activity	0.251032446	0.175514218	0.224805011	0.217117225

This class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DQA) and a beta chain (DQB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages). The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa and it contains 6 exons. Exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. Within the DQ molecule both the alpha chain and the beta chain contain the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities, resulting in up to 4 different molecules. Typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow transplantation.

	N22132	Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4	Hs.390428	MAP3K4	6	6q26	The central core of each mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved cascade of 3 protein kinases: an activated MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and activates a specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which then activates a specific MAPK. While the ERK MAPKs are activated by mitogenic stimulation, the CSBP2 and JNK MAPKs are activated by environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, UV irradiation, wound stress, and inflammatory factors. This gene encodes a MAPKKK, the MEKK4 protein, also called MTK1. This protein contains a protein kinase catalytic domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal nonkinase domain may contain a regulatory domain. Expression of MEKK4 in mammalian cells activated the CSBP2 and JNK MAPK pathways, but not the ERK pathway. In vitro kinase studies indicated that recombinant MEKK4 can specifically phosphorylate and activate PRKMK6 and SERK1, MAPKKs that activate CSBP2 and JNK, respectively but cannot phosphorylate PRKMK1, an MAPKK that activates ERKs. MEKK4 is a major mediator of environmental stresses that activate the CSBP2 MAPK pathway, and a minor mediator of the JNK pathway. Two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding distinct isoforms have been described.

Many BMPs are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) superfamily. BMPs were originally identified by an ability of demineralized bone extract to induce endochondral osteogenesis in vivo in an extraskeletal site. Based on its expression early in embryogenesis, the BMP encoded by this gene has a proposed role in early development. In addition, the fact that this BMP is closely related to BMP5 and BMP7 has led to speculation of possible bone inductive activity.	cell differentiation - cytokine activity - extracellular region - growth - growth factor activity - skeletal development	0.116641149	0.146753493	0.423700356	0.229031666

The protein also shares similarity with Diff 6 of Drosophila and with H5 of mouse. Each of these similar proteins, including the yeast CDC10, contains a GTP-binding motif. The yeast CDC10 protein is a structural component of the 10 nm filament which lies inside the cytoplasmic membrane and is essential for cytokinesis. Although the exact function of this gene has not yet been determined, its high similarity to yeast CDC10 and the high conservative nature of eukaryotic cell cycle machinery suggest a similar role to that of its yeast counterpart.

The protein encoded by this gene contains FH domains and belongs to a novel FH protein subfamily implicated in cell polarity. Wnt/Fz signaling activates the small GTPase Rho, a key regulator of cytoskeleton architecture, to control cell polarity and movement during development. Activation requires Dvl-Rho complex formation, an assembly mediated by this gene product, which is thought to function as a scaffolding protein.

They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.

The iron-induced binding to the IRE results in repression of translation of ferritin mRNA, and inhibition of degradation of the otherwise rapidly degrading transferrin receptor mRNA.  Thus, IREB1 plays a central role in cellular iron homeostasis.  It was also shown to have aconitase activity, and hence grouped with the aconitase family of enzymes.

This gene encodes a glutathione S-tranferase belonging to the alpha class. The alpha class genes, located in a cluster mapped to chromosome 6, are the most abundantly expressed glutathione S-transferases in liver. In addition to metabolizing bilirubin and certain anti-cancer drugs in the liver, the alpha class of these enzymes exhibit glutathione peroxidase activity thereby protecting the cells from reactive oxygen species and the products of peroxidation.	cytoplasm - glutathione transferase activity - metabolism - transferase activity	0.198933252	0.372199197	0.467260955	0.346131135

Gram-negative bacteria contain a glycolipid, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on their outer cell wall. Together with bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI), the encoded protein binds LPS and interacts with the CD14 receptor, probably playing a role in regulating LPS-dependent monocyte responses. Studies in mice suggest that the encoded protein is necessary for the rapid acute-phase response to LPS but not for the clearance of LPS from circulation. This protein is part of a family of structurally and functionally related proteins, including BPI, plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP).

Multiple isoforms of ankyrin with different affinities for various target proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific, developmentally regulated manner.  Most ankyrins are typically composed of three structural domains: an amino-terminal domain containing multiple ankyrin repeats; a central region with a highly conserved spectrin binding domain; and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain which is the least conserved and subject to variation.  Ankyrin 1, the prototype of this family, was first discovered in the erythrocytes, but since has also been found in brain and muscles.  Mutations in erythrocytic ankyrin 1 have been associated in approximately half of all patients with hereditary spherocytosis.  Complex patterns of alternative splicing in the regulatory domain, giving rise to different isoforms of ankyrin 1 have been described, however, the precise functions of the various isoforms are not known.

	H29923	Gamma-glutamyltransferase-like 3	Hs.433738	GGTL3	20	20q11.22	Gamma-glutamyltransferase is a membrane-associated protein involved in both the metabolism of glutathione and in the transpeptidation of amino acids. Changes in the activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase may signal preneoplastic or toxic conditions in the liver or kidney. The protein encoded by this gene is similar in sequence to gamma-glutamyltransferase, but its function is unknown. Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene.	acyltransferase activity - gamma-glutamyltransferase activity - glutathione biosynthesis - integral to membrane - transferase activity	2.483236785	6.872894817	2.363619834	3.906583812

The yeast gene was identified by its ability to complement a diphthamide mutant strain, and thus probably functions in diphthamide biosynthesis. Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue present in elongation factor 2 (EF2) that is the target of diphtheria toxin ADP-ribosylation. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	-	4.359724882	5.29814112	2.072591741	3.910152581
	R56392	Discoidin domain receptor family, member 1	Hs.631988	DDR1	6	6p21.3	Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a key role in the communication of cells with their microenvironment. These molecules are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and metabolism. The protein encoded by this gene is a RTK that is widely expressed in normal and transformed epithelial cells and is activated by various types of collagen. This protein belongs to a subfamily of tyrosine kinase receptors with a homology region to the Dictyostelium discoideum protein discoidin I in their extracellular domain. Its autophosphorylation is achieved by all collagens so far tested (type I to type VI). In situ studies and Northern-blot analysis showed that expression of this encoded protein is restricted to epithelial cells, particularly in the kidney, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. In addition, this protein is significantly over-expressed in several human tumors from breast, ovarian, esophageal, and pediatric brain. This gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3 in proximity to several HLA class I genes. Three isoforms of this gene are generated by alternative splicing.

The protein also shares similarity with Diff 6 of Drosophila and with H5 of mouse. Each of these similar proteins, including the yeast CDC10, contains a GTP-binding motif. The yeast CDC10 protein is a structural component of the 10 nm filament which lies inside the cytoplasmic membrane and is essential for cytokinesis. Although the exact function of this gene has not yet been determined, its high similarity to yeast CDC10 and the high conservative nature of eukaryotic cell cycle machinery suggest a similar role to that of its yeast counterpart. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

	R56646	Septin 5	Hs.283743	9/5/2013	22	22q11.21	This gene is a member of the septin gene family which encodes nucleotide binding proteins, originally described in yeast as cell division cycle regulatory proteins. Septins are highly conserved in yeast, Drosophila and mouse, and appear to regulate cytoskeletal organization. Disruption of septin function disturbs cytokinesis and results in large multinucleate or polyploid cells. This gene is mapped to 22q11, the region frequently deleted in DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes, and a translocation involving MLL gene and this gene has also been reported in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Two transcripts, a major one of 2.2 kb and a minor one of 3.5 kb, have been observed in the gene region. The 2.2 kb form which encodes this septin (369 amino acids) protein, results from the utilization of a non-consensus polyA_signal (AACAAT). In the absence of polyadenylation from this imperfect site, this gene uses the consensus polyA_signal within its 3 neighbour gene (GP1BB; platelet glycoprotein Ib), resulting in the 3.5 kb read-through transcript. A transcript variant with a different 5 end arising by alternative splicing, and possibly accompanied by alternative promoter usage, has also been identified.

MAP kinases act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase targets specific transcription factors, and thus mediates immediate-early gene expression in response to various cell stimuli. It is most closely related to MAPK8, both of which are involved in UV radiation induced apoptosis, thought to be related to the cytochrome c-mediated cell death pathway. This gene and MAPK8 are also known as c-Jun N-terminal kinases. This kinase blocks the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor p53, and thus it increases the stability of p53 in nonstressed cells. Studies of this genes mouse counterpart suggest a key role in T-cell differentiation.

This kinase is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression and G1/S transition. The activity of this kinase first appears in mid-G1 phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits including D-type cyclins and members of INK4 family of CDK inhibitors. This kinase, as well as CDK4, has been shown to phosphorylate, and thus regulate the activity of, tumor suppressor protein Rb.

This protein is also a member of the CARD protein family, which is defined by carrying a characteristic caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD). This protein shares a similar domain structure with CARD11 protein. The CARD domains of both proteins have been shown to specifically interact with BCL10, a protein known to function as a positive regulator of cell apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation. When expressed in cells, this protein activated NF-kappaB and induced the phosphorylation of BCL10.

	N59717	Protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, catalytic, alpha	Hs.631630	PRKACA	19	19p13.1	cAMP is a signaling molecule important for a variety of cellular functions. cAMP exerts its effects by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), which transduces the signal through phosphorylation of different target proteins. The inactive holoenzyme of AMPK is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP and two free monomeric catalytic subunits. Four different regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits of AMPK have been identified in humans. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family and is a catalytic subunit of AMPK. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.

Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L1P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. The expression of this gene is downregulated in the thymus by cyclosporin-A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug. Studies in mice have shown that the expression of the ribosomal protein L10a gene is downregulated in neural precursor cells during development. This gene previously was referred to as NEDD6 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 6), but it has been renamed RPL10A (ribosomal protein 10a). As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.	protein biosynthesis - ribosome - structural constituent of ribosome	8.340998264	4.857867846	6.712262223	6.637042778

Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L1P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. The expression of this gene is downregulated in the thymus by cyclosporin-A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug. Studies in mice have shown that the expression of the ribosomal protein L10a gene is downregulated in neural precursor cells during development. This gene previously was referred to as NEDD6 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 6), but it has been renamed RPL10A (ribosomal protein 10a). As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.	protein biosynthesis - ribosome - structural constituent of ribosome	8.329807539	11.27064205	2.427691748	7.342713779

This subunit is a member of the SOP2 family of proteins and is most similar to the protein encoded by gene ARPC1A. The similarity between these two proteins suggests that they both may function as p41 subunit of the human Arp2/3 complex that has been implicated in the control of actin polymerization in cells. It is possible that the p41 subunit is involved in assembling and maintaining the structure of the Arp2/3 complex.  Multiple versions of the p41 subunit may adapt the functions of the complex to different cell types or developmental stages.

	R72225	Collagen, type IV, alpha 3 (Goodpasture antigen)	Hs.570065	COL4A3	2	2q36-q37	This gene encodes one of the six subunits of type IV collagen, the major structural component of basement membranes. In the Goodpasture syndrome, autoantibodies bind to the collagen molecules in the basement membranes of alveoli and glomeruli. The epitopes that elicit these autoantibodies are localized largely to the non-collagenous C-terminal domain of the protein. A specific kinase phosphorylates amino acids in this same C-terminal region and the expression of this kinase is upregulated during pathogenesis. There are six alternate transcripts that appear to be unique to this human subunit gene and alternate splicing is restricted to the six exons that encode this domain. This gene is also linked to an autosomal recessive form of Alport syndrome. The mutations contributing to this syndrome are also located within the exons that encode this C-terminal region. Like the other members of the type IV collagen gene family, this gene is organized in a head-to-head conformation with another type IV collagen gene so that each gene pair shares a common promoter.	caspase activation - cell adhesion - cell proliferation - cell surface receptor linked signal transduction - circulation - collagen - collagen type IV - cytoplasm - extracellular matrix structural constituent - induction of apoptosis - integrin binding - metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity - negative regulation of angiogenesis - negative regulation of cell proliferation - perception of sound - phosphate transport - protein binding - proteolysis and peptidolysis - serine carboxypeptidase activity	7.354326663	10.29354402	6.781125175	8.142998619

Additional isoforms of many of the V1 and V0 subunit proteins are encoded by multiple genes or alternatively spliced transcript variants. This encoded protein is one of two V1 domain A subunit isoforms and is found in all tissues. Transcript variants derived from alternative polyadenylation exist.

	T75288	Ephrin-A5	Hs.658451	EFNA5	5	5q21	Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee (1997). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are similarly divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.	anchored to plasma membrane|cell differentiation|cell-cell signaling|ephrin receptor binding|extracellular space|membrane|neurogenesis	10.08328092	10.85890412	4.680952271	8.54104577

The hnRNPs are RNA binding proteins and they complex with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). These proteins are associated with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and appear to influence pre-mRNA processing and other aspects of mRNA metabolism and transport. While all of the hnRNPs are present in the nucleus, some seem to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The hnRNP proteins have distinct nucleic acid binding properties. The protein encoded by this gene has two repeats of quasi-RRM domains that bind to RNAs. It is localized in nuclear bodies of the nucleus. This protein is involved in the splicing process and it also participates in early heat shock-induced splicing arrest by transiently leaving the hnRNP complexes. Multiple alternative transcript variants seem to be present for this gene and some appear to have intronic regions in the mRNA. Presently, only two transcript variants are fully described.

The ligands of this receptor are BMPs, which are members of the TGF-beta superfamily. BMPs are involved in endochondral bone formation and embryogenesis. These proteins transduce their signals through the formation of heteromeric complexes of 2 different types of serine (threonine) kinase receptors: type I receptors of about 50-55 kD and type II receptors of about 70-80 kD. Type II receptors bind ligands in the absence of type I receptors, but they require their respective type I receptors for signaling, whereas type I receptors require their respective type II receptors for ligand binding. Mutations in this gene have been associated with primary pulmonary hypertension. This gene expresses two transcript variants.

This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1, thus serves as an adaptor linking MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein, TAB1, and MAP3K7 also participate in the signal transduction induced by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappB (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.

Forkhead box transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of tissue- and cell type-specific gene transcription during both development and adulthood. Forkhead box P1 protein contains both DNA-binding- and protein-protein binding-domains. This gene may act as a tumor suppressor as it is lost in several tumor types and maps to a chromosomal region (3p14.1) reported to contain a tumor suppressor gene(s).

	T70532	bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor	Hs.444200	BPTF	17	17q24.3	This gene was identified by the reactivity of its encoded protein to a monoclonal antibody prepared against brain homogenates from patients with Alzheimers disease. Analysis of the original protein (fetal Alz-50 reactive clone 1, or FAC1), identified as an 810 aa protein containing a DNA-binding domain and a zinc finger motif, suggested it might play a role in the regulation of transcription. High levels of FAC1 were detected in fetal brain and in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The protein encoded by this gene is actually much larger than originally thought, and it also contains a C-terminal bromodomain characteristic of proteins that regulate transcription during proliferation. The encoded protein is highly similar to the largest subunit of the Drosophila NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor) complex. In Drosophila, the NURF complex, which catalyzes nucleosome sliding on DNA and interacts with sequence-specific transcription factors, is necessary for the chromatin remodeling required for transcription. Two alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described completely.

Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order   structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H2A family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element. This gene is found in the large histone gene cluster on chromosome 6.

The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into three classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbx class. It contains an F-box motif and seven conserved helicase motifs, and has both DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA unwinding activities. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.

This membrane-bound protein has a neuregulin binding domain but not an active kinase domain. It therefore can bind this ligand but not convey the signal into the cell through protein phosphorylation. However, it does form heterodimers with other EGF receptor family members which do have kinase activity. Heterodimerization leads to the activation of pathways which lead to cell proliferation or differentiation. Amplification of this gene and/or overexpression of its protein have been reported in numerous cancers, including prostate, bladder, and breast tumors. Alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized. One isoform lacks the intermembrane region and is secreted outside the cell. This form acts to modulate the activity of the membrane-bound form. Additional splice variants have also been reported, but they have not been thoroughly characterized.

PP2C family members are known to be negative regulators of cell stress response pathways. The expression of this gene is induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to various environmental stresses. While being induced by tumor suppressor protein TP53/p53, this phosphatase negatively regulates the activity of p38 MAP kinase, MAPK/p38, through which it reduces the phosphorylation of p53, and in turn suppresses p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. This phosphatase thus mediates a feedback regulation of p38-p53 signaling that contributes to growth inhibition and the suppression of stress induced apoptosis. This gene is located in a chromosomal region known to be amplified in breast cancer. The amplification of this gene has been detected in both breast cancer cell line and primary breast tumors, which suggests a role of this gene in cancer development.	hydrolase activity - magnesium ion binding - manganese ion binding - negative regulation of cell proliferation - nucleus - protein amino acid dephosphorylation - protein amino acid dephosphorylation - protein phosphatase type 2C activity - protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity - protein serine/threonine phosphatase complex - regulation of cell cycle - response to radiation	5.388952743	24.046019	2.136782824	10.52391819

Although differing in substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and tissue distribution, all isozymes of this family convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and thereby play a key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation. This isozyme preferentially utilizes arachidonate as substrate. The absence of this enzyme may contribute to the mental retardation or Alport syndrome.

It is present on leukemic cells of pre-B phenotype, which represent 85% of cases of ALL. CALLA is not restricted to leukemic cells, however, and is found on a variety of normal tissues. CALLA is a glycoprotein that is particularly abundant in kidney, where it is present on the brush border of proximal tubules and on glomerular epithelium. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence is identical to that of human membrane-associated neutral endopeptidase, also known as enkephalinase. NEP cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues and inactivates several peptide hormones including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, and bradykinin. The CALLA gene, which encodes a 100-kD type II transmembrane glycoprotein, exists in a single copy of greater than 45 kb which is not rearranged in malignancies expressing cell surface CALLA. The CALLA gene spans more than 80 kb and is composed of 24 exons. The 5 untranslated region of CALLA is alternatively spliced, resulting in four separate mRNA transcripts. The coding region initiates in exon 3 and is not affected by alternative splicing. Exons 1, 1bis, 2a and 2b are each spliced to exon 3 to form the four transcript variants.	cell-cell signaling - integral to plasma membrane - metallopeptidase activity - neprilysin activity - plasma membrane - proteolysis and peptidolysis - zinc ion binding	9.107093974	16.09688699	7.426833346	10.8769381

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that may be a functional partner of the death associated protein 3 (DAP3).	mitochondrion - ribonucleoprotein complex - structural constituent of ribosome	14.68321425	15.1642409	3.063851198	10.97043545

The ligands of this receptor are BMPs, which are members of the TGF-beta superfamily. BMPs are involved in endochondral bone formation and embryogenesis. These proteins transduce their signals through the formation of heteromeric complexes of 2 different types of serine (threonine) kinase receptors: type I receptors of about 50-55 kD and type II receptors of about 70-80 kD. Type II receptors bind ligands in the absence of type I receptors, but they require their respective type I receptors for signaling, whereas type I receptors require their respective type II receptors for ligand binding. Mutations in this gene have been associated with primary pulmonary hypertension. This gene expresses two transcript variants.

	AA203405	Huntingtin (Huntington disease)	Hs.518450	HD	4	4p16.3	Huntingtin is a disease gene linked to Huntingtons disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons.  This is thought to be caused by an expanded,  unstable trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene, which translates as a polyglutamine repeat in the protein product.  The huntingtin locus is large, spanning 180 kb and consisting of 67 exons. The huntingtin gene is widely expressed and is required for normal development.  It is expressed as 2 alternatively polyadenylated forms displaying different relative abundance in various fetal and adult tissues.  The larger transcript is approximately 13.7 kb and is expressed predominantly in adult and fetal brain whereas the smaller transcript of approximately 10.3 kb is more widely expressed.  The genetic defect leading to Huntingtons disease may not necessarily eliminate transcription, but may confer a new property on the mRNA or alter the function of the protein. One candidate is the huntingtin-associated protein-1, highly expressed in brain, which has increased affinity for huntingtin protein with expanded polyglutamine repeats.	apoptosis - behavior - cytoplasm - induction of apoptosis - microtubule binding - nucleus - organogenesis - pathogenesis - protein binding - soluble fraction - transcription corepressor activity - transporter activity	12.29549058	18.55944737	4.781444904	11.87879428

FNBP4	T96595	Fetal Alzheimer antigen	Hs.444200	BPTF	17	17q24.3	This gene was identified by the reactivity of its encoded protein to a monoclonal antibody prepared against brain homogenates from patients with Alzheimers disease. Analysis of the original protein (fetal Alz-50 reactive clone 1, or FAC1), identified as an 810 aa protein containing a DNA-binding domain and a zinc finger motif, suggested it might play a role in the regulation of transcription. High levels of FAC1 were detected in fetal brain and in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The protein encoded by this gene is actually much larger than originally thought, and it also contains a C-terminal bromodomain characteristic of proteins that regulate transcription during proliferation. The encoded protein is highly similar to the largest subunit of the Drosophila NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor) complex. In Drosophila, the NURF complex, which catalyzes nucleosome sliding on DNA and interacts with sequence-specific transcription factors, is necessary for the chromatin remodeling required for transcription. Two alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described completely.

Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

ARPC5	N43985	Ataxin 2	Hs.76253	ATXN2	12	12q24.1	The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. Clinically, ADCA has been divided into three groups: ADCA types I-III. ADCAI is genetically heterogeneous, with five genetic loci, designated spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, being assigned to five different chromosomes. ADCAII, which always presents with retinal degeneration (SCA7), and ADCAIII often referred to as the pure cerebellar syndrome (SCA5), are most likely homogeneous disorders. Several SCA genes have been cloned and shown to contain CAG repeats in their coding regions. ADCA is caused by the expansion of the CAG repeats, producing an elongated polyglutamine tract in the corresponding protein. The expanded repeats are variable in size and unstable, usually increasing in size when transmitted to successive generations. The function of the ataxins is not known. This locus has been mapped to chromosome 12, and it has been determined that the diseased allele contains 36-52 CAG repeats, compared to 22-23 in the normal allele.

PTPs catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphate monoesters specifically on tyrosine residues. Members of the PTP family share a highly conserved catalytic motif, which is essential for the catalytic activity. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP has been shown to act as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by dephosphorylating the phosphotryosine residues of insulin receptor kinase. This PTP was also reported to dephosphorylate epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, as well as JAK2 and TYK2 kinases, which implicated the role of this PTP in cell growth control, and cell response to interferon stimulation.	cytoplasm - hydrolase activity - protein amino acid dephosphorylation - protein tyrosine phosphatase activity - signal transduction - soluble fraction	11.74279812	33.40721151	2.139821444	15.76327702

Studies in yeast demonstrated that ORC binds specifically to origins of replication and serves as a platform for the assembly of additional initiation factors such as Cdc6 and Mcm proteins. The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the ORC complex. It has been shown that this protein and and ORC1L are loosely associated with the core complex consisting of ORC2L, -3L, -4L and -5L. Gene silencing studies with small interfering RNA demonstrated that this protein plays an essential  role in coordinating chromosome replication and segregation with cytokinesis.

SAMHD1	H85763	Retinoblastoma-like 1 (p107)	Hs.207745	RBL1	20	20q11.2	The protein encoded by this gene is similar in sequence and possibly function to the product of the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene. The RB1 gene product is a tumor suppressor protein that appears to be involved in cell cycle regulation, as it is phosphorylated in the S to M phase transition and is dephosphorylated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Both the RB1 protein and the product of this gene can form a complex with adenovirus E1A protein and SV40 large T-antigen, with the SV40 large T-antigen binding only to the unphosphorylated form of each protein. In addition, both proteins can inhibit the transcription of cell cycle genes containing E2F binding sites in their promoters. Due to the sequence and biochemical similarities with the RB1 protein, it is thought that the protein encoded by this gene may also be a tumor suppressor. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein contains a SH3 domain and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This protein associates with JAK3 and JAK2 kinases via its ITAM region, and is phosphorylated by the JAK kinases upon cytokine stimulation, which suggests the function of this protein is as an adaptor molecule involved in the downstream signaling of cytokine receptors.

XKRX	AA010021	Laminin, beta 1	Hs.650585	LAMB1	7	7q22	Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes.  They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis.  Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains.  Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene.  Several isoforms of each chain have been described.  Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1.  The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo.  This gene encodes the beta chain isoform laminin, beta 1.  The beta 1 chain has 7 structurally distinct domains which it shares with other beta chain isomers.  The C-terminal helical region containing domains I and II are separated by domain alpha, domains III and V contain several EGF-like repeats, and domains IV and VI have a globular conformation.  Laminin, beta 1 is expressed in most tissues that produce basement membranes, and is one of the 3 chains constituting laminin 1, the first laminin isolated from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor.  A sequence in the beta 1 chain that is involved in cell attachment, chemotaxis, and binding to the laminin receptor was identified and shown to have the capacity to inhibit metastasis.	basement membrane - cell adhesion - protein binding - structural molecule activity	22.67261415	29.16679273	2.141966062	17.99379098

CDK family members are highly similar to the gene products of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc28, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2, and are known to be important regulators of cell cycle progression. This kinase is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression and G1/S transition. The activity of this kinase first appears in mid-G1 phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits including D-type cyclins and members of INK4 family of CDK inhibitors. This kinase, as well as CDK4, has been shown to phosphorylate, and thus regulate the activity of, tumor suppressor protein Rb.

The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins and plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. It associates with three other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming complex.

It shares similarity with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) in that it is ubiquitously expressed, and hydrolyzes the same substrates. These similarities suggest that like DPPIV, this protein may play a role in T-cell activation and immune function. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.	catalytic activity - cytoplasm - cytoplasm - dipeptidyl-peptidase IV activity - dipeptidyl-peptidase activity - dipeptidyl-peptidase activity - immune response - membrane - proteolysis and peptidolysis - proteolysis and peptidolysis - proteolysis and peptidolysis - serine-type peptidase activity	23.41114548	35.51527885	4.428832382	21.1184189

	R14123	Glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2	Hs.480281	GRID2	4	4q22	Human glutamate receptor delta-2 (GRID2) is a relatively new member of the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors which are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain.  GRID2 is a predicted 1,007 amino acid protein that shares 97% identity with the mouse homolog which is expressed selectively in cerebellar Purkinje cells.  A point mutation in mouse GRID2, associated with the phenotype named lurcher, in the heterozygous state leads to ataxia resulting from selective, cell-autonomous apoptosis of cerebellar Purkinje cells during postnatal development. Mice homozygous for this mutation die shortly after birth from massive loss of mid- and hindbrain neurons during late embryogenesis.  This strongly suggests a role for GRID2 in neuronal apoptotic death.	glutamate signaling pathway - glutamate-gated ion channel activity - integral to plasma membrane - ion channel activity - ion transport - ionotropic glutamate receptor activity - membrane - receptor activity - synaptic transmission - transporter activity	18.56192015	38.94848633	7.111515922	21.5406408
