Genes	Full names	Functions	Role in ovarian cancer
GPX3	Glutathione peroxidase 3	Phase II metabolism enzyme	Found highly expressed in clear cell adenocarcinoma cell lines. Its downregulation in these cells increased cisplatin sensitivity by 3- to 4-fold (33, 44)
APC	Adenomatosis polyposis coli/Tumor suppressor	Regulates cellular differentiation, energy metabolism, cytoskeletal membrane interactions, and cell-cycle progression	Role as a marker in ovarian cancer has yet to be elucidated.
BAG3	BCL2-associated athanogene 3	Antiapoptotic marker	Role as a marker in ovarian cancer has yet to be elucidated
S100A10	Calcium-binding protein S100A10	Regulates cellular differentiation, energy metabolism, cytoskeletal membrane interactions, and cell-cycle progression	Role as a marker in ovarian cancer has yet to be elucidated.
EGFR	Epidermal growth factor receptor	Activation of signal transduction cascades	Role as a marker in ovarian cancer is controversial (23–25)
ITGAE	Integrin, alpha E	Cell adhesion	Found in a 9-gene signature predicting platinum resistance (36)
MAPK3/ERK1	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3	Activation of signal transduction cascades	Phosphorylated ERK1 level found increased in platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines (45)
TAP1/ABCB2	Antigen peptide transporter 2	Peptide transport into the ER lumen for subsequent loading onto MHC class I molecules	Upregulation of this gene in approximately 70% of the specimens profiled from 150 patients with invasive epithelial ovarian cancers (35)
BNIP3	BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein interacting protein 3	Proapoptotic and autophagy marker	BNIP sequestration in the nucleus was shown in a number of lung cancer and GBM specimens with the worst prognosis (28, 29)
MMP9	Matrix metallopeptidase 9	Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix	Found expressed in surgical specimens of ovarian cancer (46). Mediator of EGF-dependent e-cadherin loss in ovarian cancer cells (47)
FASLG	Fas ligand	Proapoptotic marker	Release of FASLG may provide a mechanism by which tumor cells escape from immune surveillance and promote tumor cell survival (48)
