Symbol	Gene name	Chromosome	Category	Function
A2BP1	Ataxin-2-binding protein 1	16p13.3	GC/ND	Expression in mature neural tissues; Binding partner ataxin-2 sensitizes neuroblastoma cells for apoptosis
CHRNA7	Cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, ? polypeptide 7	15q14	GC/ND	Expression in differentiating neuronal cells and mature neural tissues; Involved in synaptic functions or transmitter release; Induction of apoptotic cell death
CNR1	Cannabinoid receptor 1 (brain)	6q14-q15	GC/ND	Expression in differentiating neuronal cells and mature neural tissues; Induced or up-regulated on retinoid acid triggered cellular differentiation; Induction of apoptotic cell death; Inhibition of proliferation and induction of cell cycle arrest
DST	Dystonin	6p12-p11	GC/ND	Expression in differentiating neuronal cells; Loss of expression in malignant cells
IGSF4	Immunoglobulin superfamily, member 4	11q23.2	GC/ND	Expression in mature neural tissues; contribution to specific processes of neuronal differentiation; involved in synaptic functions; Induction of apoptotic cells death; inhibition of proliferation; Decrease or loss of expression in malignant cells; tumor growth suppression in nude mice
