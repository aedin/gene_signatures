hsa-mir-30a	Chr 6; Location: 6q13	higher	lower		MAP3K5, RAB32, SOC1	marker of metastasis in lung cancer and in acute renal allograft rejection	SOC1 target of this miR is disregulated in Melanoma (see Table 11). let-7c, miR-10b, miR-30a-3p, miR30e-3p collectively underexpressed in a rejection microenvironement(renal acute rejection biopsies ) [70] but upregulated in our study in adult melanomas
hsa-miR-29c	Chr1; Location: 1q32.2	higher	lower		COL4A5,COL9A1,COL6A2,COL4A1,COL16A1,ADAMTS7,ADAMTS10,COL6A3,COL5A3,COL3A1,COL11A1,TNFRSF1A,TNIP2	Potential regulatory function in the stroma surrounding the tumor microenvironment,     targets extracellular matrix proteins collagen alpha-chain precursors, disintegrin an metalloproteinase precursors (ADAMS), TNF related proteins
hsa-miR-99b	Chr9 Location:q34.11	higher	lower	Calmodulin 2( CALM 2) mediates the control of protein kinases and phosphatases; also involved in the pathway that regulates the centrosome cycle and progression through cytokinesis		hsa-miR 99b, miR-10, miR-125b, miR-30 involved in pathways of local invasion in prostate cancer .These miRs were greater than 2 folds  upregulated in prostate cancer with Perineural invasion (PNI), the dominant pathway for local invasion in prostate cancer, than in prostate cancer without PNI [60].
hsa-miR146b	Chr5 q34 Location:	higher	lower				Upregulation in the > 60 years group confirms Upregulation in  melanoma with vertical growth pattern and metastatic [32]
Hsa-miR-211	Chr: 15; Location: 15q13.3, a locus frequently altered in cancers but not in melanoma	low	higher		PLXDC2 (plexin) Tumor endothelial marker 7-related protein CCR10 chemokine receptor (receptor for MCP1,3,4,RANTES,CTAK) CWF19L1 (CWF19-like 1 Cell cycle control)	Potential Master-immunoregulatory role ?
