FGF-family	FGF22
PDGF	PDGFB	Vessel stabilization
PDGF	PDGFA
PDGF	PDGFC
PDGF	PDGFD
TGF-beta	TGF-beta41	Tube formation in vitro (low doses), vessel stabilization, angiogenesis in vivo in inflammatory environments
HGF	HGF	Migration and proliferation of EC, angiogenesis in vivo
TIMP-family	TIMP3	The proteins encoded by this gene family are inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases, a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Expression of this gene is induced in response to mitogenic stimulation and this netrin domain-containing protein is localized into the ECM.
CXC chemokines with ELR motif	CXCL12	EC proliferation, EC migration, angiogenesis in vivo
CXC chemokines with ELR motif	CXCL6
Integrins	ITGB3	EC attachment, EC migration, 2 EC apoptosis, essential for FGF induced angiogenesis
Integrins	ITGA2
Integrins	ITGA9
Integrins	ITGB6
VE-Cadherin	CDH2	Vessel stabilization, 2 EC apoptosis, essential for angiogenesis in vivo
MMPs	MMP19	ECM degradation
MMPs	MMP17
MMPs	MMP16
