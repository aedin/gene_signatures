Code	Gene name	Symbol	Intensity	Frequency (%)~	Putative function
A08g	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase	TIMP3	+++	11 /11 (100%)	Plays pivotal roles in the regulation of ECM metabolism; inhibits activity of MMPs; is a bifunctional molecule that promotes growth and oncogenic transformation in some cell types. TIMP3 overexpression has been observed in breast carcinomas.
A12d	Epidermal growth factor receptor	EGFR	++	11 /11 (100%)	Involved in the control of cell proliferation
F11e	DR-nm23		++	7 /11 (64%)	Binds DNA; involved in cell differentiation; implicated in pathogenesis and metastasis of tumors
A03c	c-myc oncogene		++	8 /11 (73%)	Transcription factor; promotes cell proliferation and transformation.
E13j	Glia derived neurite promoting factor	GDNPF	+	11 /11 (100%)	Involved in the maintenance of normal function in the nervous system; promotes survival and growth of spinal motoneurons during the period of programmed cell death and after injury
F09b	nm23-H4		+	10 /11 (91%)	Regulates a diverse array of cellular events including growth and development; implicated in the pathogenesis of tumor and metastasis
