Gene Symbol	Gene name	Primary known cellular functions of the encoded protein
AKR1C3	Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) C3	Catalyze the conversion of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols, using NADH, NADPH, or both as cofactors. Inactivate steroid hormones in the liver, regulate 5-dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate, and form the neurosteroid allopregnanolone in the central nervous system. AKR1 C2 mRNA significantly downregulated in approximately half of prostate cancers examined.
AKR1C2	AKR C2
AKR1C1	AKR C1
PPARA	Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) angiopoietin-related protein1	Shows hypoxia-induced expression in endothelial cells; plays important roles in angiogenesis.
CA9	Carbonic anhydrase IX	A membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase strongly induced by hypoxia; overexpressed in a variety of tumor types; associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis.
GSTK1	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) A41	GST class; encodes enzymes with glutathione peroxidase activity that function in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation products.
TGFB1	Transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1)1	A multifunctional peptide that controls proliferation and EMT in a context-dependent fashion, inhibiting growth of some cancer cells while promoting EMT of Ras-transformed cells. Made as a latent protein that requires processing to activate.
WISP1	Wnt signaling inducible secreted protein 1. (WISP-1)1	A member of a family of cysteine-rich, glycosylated signaling proteins that mediate diverse developmental processes; binds to decorin and biglycan, which promote tumor cell proliferation. Attenuates p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage through activation of the Akt kinase.
BMP6	Bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6)1	Expressed and functions early in embryogenesis; closely related to BMP5 and BMP7 and might have possible bone inductive activity.
