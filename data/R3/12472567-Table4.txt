Gene	Frequencies in common MCL	Frequencies in blastoid variant MCL	Biological function	Suggested role in MCL	Expression
MYC	0	44%	Major cell cycle regulator (G1 to S transition); apoptosis activator.	Oncogene	Up-regulated
BCL2	33%	56%	Anti-apoptotic oncogene	Oncogene	Up-regulated
TOP1	67%	11%	Relaxes DNA supercoils by cleaving a single strand of duplex DNA and passing the complimentary DNA strand through the cleaved strand before religation.	Not known	Up-regulated
IL1B	11%	44%	Interleukin-1b precursor	Not known	Up-regulated
PTPRC	56%	0	A transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase; essential for the activation of T and B cells; involved in the integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of immune cells; negatively regulates interleukin 3-mediated cellular proliferation, erythropoietin-dependent haematopoiesis, and antiviral responses in vitro and in vivo.	Tumour suppressor	Up-regulated
CD58	44%	67%	CD58 antigen	Not known	Up-regulated
TNFSF4	11%	44%	OX40 ligand	Not known	Up-regulated
CD70	22%	56%	Belong to the tumour necrosis factor superfamily. Together with its receptor CD27, they act as a checkpoint in lymphocyte survival early after antigenic stimulation.	Oncogene	Up-regulated
NFATC1	56%	11%	Transcription factor that plays a central role in inducing gene transcription during the immune response.	Functions through downstream targets	Up-regulated
PIM1	0%	56%	Cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase; regulator of bcl2; promotes cell proliferation and prevents apoptosis.	Oncogene	Up-regulated
FCER2	33%	67%	A low-affinity receptor for IgE; cell surface marker that is negative in MCL but positive in small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL/CLL); also used to distinguish transformed SLL/CLL from MCL blastoid variant.	Not known	Down-regulated
CR2	22%	33%	Complement C3D receptor	Not known	Down-regulated
