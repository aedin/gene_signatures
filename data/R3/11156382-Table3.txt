Code	Gene name	Symbol	Intensity ratio (mean T/mean N)	Frequency (%)~	Putative function
F12m		AAD14	4.17	6 /11 (55%)	Encodes a neuronal, small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel.
F04k	60S ribosomal protein L5	rpL5	2.95	7 /11 (64%)	A Mr 34,000 large ribosomal subunit protein; forms complex with p53 and protein kinase CK2 and MDM-2; abnormal pattern of rpL5 transcripts has been observed in some colorectal cancer patients, and overexpression of rpL5 was found in prostate cancer cell lines
D03m	Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein	LRP	2.87	6 /10 (60%)	Multifunctional cell surface receptor; involved in lipoprotein metabolism, and cellular lipid uptake
F14a	Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine precursor	SPARC	2.33	4 /11 (36%)	Interacts with ECM components and regulates activation of MMPs; may be involved in tumor invasion; highly expressed in a variety of human neoplasms
B04n	B-cell receptor-associated protein	hBAP	2.33	3 /11 (27%)	A protein with sequence similarity to prohibitin; involved in lymphocyte function
E10b	Pleiotrophin precursor	PTN	2.11	4 /11 (36%)	Heparin-binding growth/differentiation factor; plays role in tumor growth and angiogenesis
A02e	Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha subunit	PDGFR-alpha	2.07	2 /10 (20%)	Binds all three PDGF isoforms; a number of different signaling pathways can be initiated leading to cell growth, actin reorgonization, migration, and differentiation.
