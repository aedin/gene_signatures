GOLGA4	3p22.2	golgi autoantigen, golgin subfamily a, 4	vesicle-mediated transport	NA	membrane fraction gogli aparatus	The Golgi apparatus, which participates in glycosylation and transport of proteins and lipids in the secretory pathway, consists of a series of stacked cisternae (flattened membrane sacs). Interactions between the Golgi and microtubules are thought to be important for the reorganization of the Golgi after it fragments during mitosis. The golgins are a family of proteins, of which the protein encoded by this gene is a member, that are localized to the Golgi. This protein has been postulated to play a role in Rab6-regulated membrane-tethering events in the Golgi apparatus. Alternative splice variants have been described but their full-length nature has not been determined
CTDSPL	3p22.2	CTD (carboxy-terminal domain, RNA polymerase II, polypeptide A) small phosphatase-like	NA	phosphoric monoester hydrolase activity	nucleus		Homozygously deleted in SCLC cell line, functional studies show suppression of tumorigenic potential, alternative mechanisms include methylation of bidirectional promoters (recent study) in leukemia and myeloid cell lines.

TMEM158	3p21.31	transmembrane protein 158	NA	NA	NA	Constitutive activation of the Ras pathway triggers an irreversible proliferation arrest reminiscent of replicative senescence. Transcription of this gene is upregulated in response to activation of the Ras pathway, but not under other conditions that induce senescence. The encoded protein is similar to a rat cell surface receptor proposed to function in a neuronal survival pathway.	Upregulated in normal ovarian surface epithelial cells compared to malignant serous tumor cells of the ovary.	7

Involved in neurite extension by neurons via heterophilic and homophilic interactions. May play a role in the binding of T- and B-cells to activated leukocytes, as well as in interactions between cells of the nervous system	increased expression in melanoma metastasis; upregulation in gene expression in low grade prostate tumors down regulation in high grade prostate tumors.

KPNA1	3q21.1	karyopherin alpha 1 (importin alpha 5)	regulation of DNA recombination, NLS-bearing substrate import into nucleus, intracellular protein transport, protein import into nucleus, transport	protein binding, nuclear localization sequence binding, protein transporter activity	nucleus , cytoplasm	Recombination activating proteins RAG1 and RAG2 regulate and mediate V(D)J recombination, the process by which genes for immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors are generated. Several other ubiquitously expressed proteins are thought to be recruited in the recombination process. Among these are the genes affected in severe combined immune deficiency and genes involved in ds-DNA break repair. The protein encoded by this gene interacts with RAG1 and may play a role in V(D)J recombination

The enzyme (cofactors iron and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks. Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIB have deficiencies in lysyl hydroxylase activity. Mutations in the coding region of this gene are associated with Bruck syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
