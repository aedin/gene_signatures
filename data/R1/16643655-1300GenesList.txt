Titin is a giant elastic protein with kinase activity that extends half the length of a sarcomere. It serves as a scaffold to which myofibrils and other muscle related proteins are attached. This gene encodes a protein found in striated and cardiac muscle that binds to the titin Z1-Z2 domains and is a substrate of titin kinase, interactions thought to be critical to sarcomere assembly. Mutations in this gene are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G.	cellular component|cytoplasm|NR|GO:0005737|GOA|na//biological process|protein complex assembly|TAS|GO:0006461|GOA|9817758//biological process|sarcomere alignment|TAS|GO:0006938|GOA|9817758//molecular function|structural constituent of muscle|TAS|GO:0008307|GOA|9350988		muscle assembly regulating factor.	sarcomeric.

They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.

They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.

It was initially isolated as 2.2 kb vascular anticoagulant-beta transcript from human placenta, a Ca (2+) dependent phospholipid binding protein that inhibits coagulation and phospholipase A2 activity.  However, the fact that annexin VIII is neither an extracellular protein nor associated with the cell surface suggests that it may not play a role in blood coagulation in vivo and its physiological role  remains unknown.

Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene encodes a replication-independent member of the histone H2A family that is distinct from other members of the family. Studies in mice have shown that this particular histone is required for embryonic development and indicate that lack of functional histone H2A leads to embryonic lethality.	molecular function|DNA binding|NAS|GO:0003677|GOA|3344202//cellular component|chromosome|IEA|GO:0005694|GOA|na//biological process|chromosome organization and biogenesis (sensu Eukarya)|NAS|GO:0007001|GOA|na//cellular component|nucleosome|NAS|GO:0000786|GOA|na//biological process|nucleosome assembly|NAS|GO:0006334|GOA|3344202//cellular component|nucleus|IEA|GO:0005634|GOA|na		variant histones h2a are synthesized throughout the cell cycle and are very different from classical s-phase regulated h2a. the exact function of variant histones h2a is not known.	nuclear.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. A pseudogene corresponding to this gene is found on chromosome 6p.

It is an important effector controlling blood pressure and volume in the cardiovascular system. It acts through at least two types of receptors. This gene encodes the type 1 receptor which is thought to mediate the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. AGTR1 may play role in the generation of reperfusion arrhythmias following restoration of blood flow to ischemic or infarcted myocardium. It was previously thought that a related gene AGTR1B exists; however, it is now believed that there is only one AGTR1 gene. The gene expresses at least four transcript variants; additional variants have been described but their full length nature has not been determined. Exon 5 contains the entire coding sequence and is present in all transcript variants.	biological process|G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway|NAS|GO:0007186|GOA|8135787//molecular function|angiotensin type II receptor activity|NAS|GO:0004945|GOA|8135787//molecular function|angiotensin type II receptor activity|TAS|GO:0004945|GOA|8135787//biological process|circulation|NR|GO:0008015|GOA|8135787//biological process|cytosolic calcium ion concentration elevation|TAS|GO:0007204|GOA|1567413//biological process|fluid secretion|NR|GO:0007589|GOA|na//cellular component|integral to membrane|NAS|GO:0016021|GOA|8135787//cellular component|integral to plasma membrane|TAS|GO:0005887|GOA|1378723//molecular function|rhodopsin-like receptor activity|IEA|GO:0001584|GOA|na		receptor for angiotensin ii. mediates its action by association with g proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol- calcium second messenger system.	integral membrane protein.

Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes ribosomal protein S4, a component of the 40S subunit. Ribosomal protein S4 is the only ribosomal protein known to be encoded by more than one gene, namely this gene and ribosomal protein S4, X-linked (RPS4X). The 2 isoforms encoded by these genes are not identical, but are functionally equivalent. Ribosomal protein S4 belongs to the S4E family of ribosomal proteins. It has been suggested that haploinsufficiency of the ribosomal protein S4 genes plays a role in Turner syndrome; however, this hypothesis is controversial. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.	molecular function|RNA binding|TAS|GO:0003723|GOA|2124517//cellular component|cytosolic small ribosomal subunit (sensu Eukarya)|TAS|GO:0005843|GOA|2124517//cellular component|intracellular|IEA|GO:0005622|GOA|na//biological process|protein biosynthesis|TAS|GO:0006412|GOA|2124517//cellular component|ribosome|IEA|GO:0005840|GOA|na//molecular function|structural constituent of ribosome|TAS|GO:0003735|GOA|2124517

The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H2B family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element.

The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H2A family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails; instead, they contain a palindromic termination element.

Knockout studies in mice also suggest the importance of this protein in early T cell development.	biological process|antimicrobial humoral response (sensu Vertebrata)|NR|GO:0019735|GOA|na//biological process|cell surface receptor linked signal transduction|NR|GO:0007166|GOA|na//cellular component|cytoplasm|NR|GO:0005737|GOA|na//molecular function|death receptor binding|TAS|GO:0005123|GOA|7538907//biological process|induction of apoptosis via death domain receptors|TAS|GO:0008625|GOA|7538907//biological process|positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade|IEP|GO:0043123|GOA|12761501//molecular function|protein binding|IEA|GO:0005515|GOA|na//biological process|regulation of apoptosis|IEA|GO:0042981|GOA|na//molecular function|signal transducer activity|IEP|GO:0004871|GOA|12761501		apoptotic adaptor molecule that recruits caspase-8 or caspase-10 to the activated fas (cd95) or tnfr-1 receptors. the resulting aggregate called the death-inducing signaling complex (disc) performs caspase-8 proteolytic activation. active caspase-8 initiates the subsequent cascade of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteases) mediating apoptosis.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. A pseudogene corresponding to this gene is found at 17p13.3.

It is located in the Xq28 region, arranged in a compact head-to-head manner with the IDH3G gene. These two genes are driven by a bidirectional promoter located between them, and encode proteins involved in unrelated biochemical pathways located in different compartments of the cell. The nontranscribed intergenic region represents only 133 bp and is embedded in a CpG island. The CpG island functions as a bidirectional promoter to initiate the transcription of both functionally unrelated genes with distinct expression patterns. SSR4 consists of six exons and is approximately 70 kb telomeric to the ALD gene. Although alternative splicing of exon 5 has not been detected in human SSR4, transcript variants missing the region homologous to human exon 5 have been detected in both Xenopus laevis and Mus musculus.	molecular function|calcium ion binding|NAS|GO:0005509|GOA|na//cellular component|endoplasmic reticulum|IEA|GO:0005783|GOA|na//cellular component|integral to membrane|IEA|GO:0016021|GOA|na//biological process|intracellular protein transport|NAS|GO:0006886|GOA|na//cellular component|translocon|NAS|GO:0005784|GOA|7492314,9286695		trap proteins are part of a complex whose function is to bind calcium to the er membrane and thereby regulate the retention of er resident proteins.	type i membrane protein. endoplasmic reticulum.

This isozyme activates long-chain, branched-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids containing 22 or more carbons to their CoA derivatives. It is expressed primarily in liver and kidney, and is present in both endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes but not in mitochondria. Its decreased peroxisomal enzyme activity is in part responsible for the biochemical pathology in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.	cellular component|endoplasmic reticulum|TAS|GO:0005783|GOA|10198260//cellular component|integral to membrane|IEA|GO:0016021|GOA|na//molecular function|ligase activity|IEA|GO:0016874|GOA|na//molecular function|long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase activity|TAS|GO:0004467|GOA|10198260//biological process|metabolism|IEA|GO:0008152|GOA|na//cellular component|peroxisomal matrix|TAS|GO:0005782|GOA|10198260//biological process|very-long-chain fatty acid metabolism|TAS|GO:0000038|GOA|10198260			integral membrane protein. peroxisomal.

The PKC family comprises at least eight members, which are differentially expressed and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. This protein kinase is calcium-independent and phospholipid-dependent. It is not activated by phorbolesters or diacylglycerol. This kinase can be recruited to vesicle tubular clusters (VTCs) by direct interaction with the small GTPase RAB2, where this kinase phosphorylates glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD/GAPDH) and plays a role in microtubule dynamics in the early secretory pathway. This kinase is found to be necessary for BCL-ABL-mediated resistance to drug-induced apoptosis and therefore protects leukemia cells against drug-induced apoptosis.

Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.

It is an anaphase-promoting complex (APC) substrate that associates with a separin until activation of the APC. The gene product has transforming activity in vitro and tumorigenic activity in vivo, and the gene is highly expressed in various tumors. The gene product contains 2 PXXP motifs, which are required for its transforming and tumorigenic activities, as well as for its stimulation of basic fibroblast growth factor expression. It also contains a destruction box (D box) that is required for its degradation by the APC. The acidic C-terminal region of the encoded protein can act as a transactivation domain.

This gene is preferentially expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells, and is an early response gene in lymphokine stimulated cells. The noncatalytic N-terminus of this PTP can interact with MAP kinases and suppress the MAP kinase activities. This PTP was shown to be involved in the regulation of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, which was thought to function through dephosphorylating the molecules related to MAP kinase pathway. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene, which encode two distinct isoforms, are reported.	cellular component|cytoplasm|TAS|GO:0005737|GOA|7545170//molecular function|hydrolase activity|IEA|GO:0016787|GOA|na//biological process|protein amino acid dephosphorylation|IEA|GO:0006470|GOA|1530918//biological process|protein amino acid dephosphorylation|TAS|GO:0006470|GOA|1530918//molecular function|protein tyrosine phosphatase activity|IEA|GO:0004725|GOA|1530918//molecular function|protein tyrosine phosphatase activity|TAS|GO:0004725|GOA|1530918		may play a role in the regulation of t and b lymphocyte development and signal transduction.	cytoplasmic.

The X-linked members are clustered on chromosome Xp22 and Y-linked members are two identical copies of the gene within a palindromic region on Yq11. The family members share a high degree of sequence identity, with the exception that a 30-bp unit is tandemly repeated in X-linked members but occurs only once in Y-linked members. The VCX gene cluster is polymorphic in terms of copy number; different individuals may have a different number of VCX genes. VCX/Y genes encode small and highly charged proteins of unknown function. The presence of a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal suggests that VCX/Y members are nuclear proteins.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein.	cellular component|intracellular|IEA|GO:0005622|GOA|na//cellular component|mitochondrion|IEA|GO:0005739|GOA|na//biological process|protein biosynthesis|IEA|GO:0006412|GOA|na//cellular component|ribosome|IEA|GO:0005840|GOA|na//molecular function|structural constituent of ribosome|IEA|GO:0003735|GOA|na

Active in this context usually means that the molecule acts as a signal to trigger other events in the cell. When an extracellular ligand binds to a G-protein-linked receptor, the receptor changes its conformation and switches on the trimeric G proteins that associate with it by causing them to eject their GDP and replace it with GTP. The switch is turned off when the G protein hydrolyzes its own bound GTP, converting it back to GDP. But before that occurs, the active protein has an opportunity to diffuse away from the receptor and deliver its message for a prolonged period to its downstream target.	molecular function|GTP binding|IEA|GO:0005525|GOA|na//cellular component|nucleus|IEA|GO:0005634|GOA|na

Based on their biochemical, immunologic, and structural properties, the soluble GSTs are categorized into 4 main classes: alpha, mu, pi, and theta.  The glutathione S-transferase pi gene (GSTP1) is a polymorphic gene encoding active, functionally different GSTP1 variant proteins that are thought to function in xenobiotic metabolism and play a role in susceptibility to cancer, and other diseases.	biological process|central nervous system development|TAS|GO:0007417|GOA|9802272//molecular function|glutathione transferase activity|IEA|GO:0004364|GOA|na//biological process|metabolism|IEA|GO:0008152|GOA|na//molecular function|transferase activity|IEA|GO:0016740|GOA|na		conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide number of exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S14P family.	cellular component|intracellular|IEA|GO:0005622|GOA|na//cellular component|mitochondrial ribosome|NAS|GO:0005761|GOA|10938081//cellular component|mitochondrion|IEA|GO:0005739|GOA|na//biological process|protein biosynthesis|NAS|GO:0006412|GOA|10938081//cellular component|ribosome|IEA|GO:0005840|GOA|na//molecular function|structural constituent of ribosome|TAS|GO:0003735|GOA|10938081

This protein shares strong similarity with DNA replication factor C (RFC), and can form a complex with RFCs. This protein binds to chromatin prior to DNA damage and is phosphorylated by ATR after the damage. This protein recruits the RAD1-RAD9-HUS1 checkpoint protein complex onto chromatin after DNA damage, which may be required for its phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of this protein is required for the DNA-damage-induced cell cycle G2 arrest, and is thought to be a critical early event during checkpoint signaling in DNA-damaged cells.

It belongs to the creatine kinase isoenzyme family. It exists as two isoenzymes, sarcomeric MtCK and ubiquitous MtCK, encoded by separate genes. Mitochondrial creatine kinase occurs in two different oligomeric forms: dimers and octamers, in contrast to the exclusively dimeric cytosolic creatine kinase isoenzymes. Many malignant cancers with poor prognosis have shown overexpression of ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase, this may be related to high energy turnover and failure to eliminate cancer cells via apoptosis. Ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase has 80% homology with the coding exons of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase.	molecular function|creatine kinase activity|TAS|GO:0004111|GOA|2914937//cellular component|mitochondrion|TAS|GO:0005739|GOA|2914937//molecular function|transferase activity, transferring phosphorus-containing groups|IEA|GO:0016772|GOA|na		reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between atp and various phosphogens (e.g. creatine phosphate). creatine kinase isoenzymes play a central role in energy transduction in tissues with large, fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, heart, brain and spermatozoa.	mitochondrial inner membrane; outer side.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S6P family. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 1p and 12q.	cellular component|intracellular|IEA|GO:0005622|GOA|na//cellular component|mitochondrion|IEA|GO:0005739|GOA|na//biological process|protein biosynthesis|NAS|GO:0006412|GOA|11279123//cellular component|small ribosomal subunit|NAS|GO:0015935|GOA|11279123//molecular function|structural constituent of ribosome|NAS|GO:0003735|GOA|11279123			mitochondrial.

It is a multi-subunit enzyme complex that couples the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and contributes to a proton electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The complex consists of 13 mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits perform the electron transfer of proton pumping activities. The functions of the nuclear-encoded subunits are unknown but they may play a role in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This gene encodes the nuclear-encoded subunit Va of the human mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme.

Importin-alpha must then be returned to the cytoplasm, leaving the NLS protein behind. The protein encoded by this gene binds strongly to NLS-free importin-alpha, and this binding is released in the cytoplasm by the combined action of RANBP1 and RANGAP1.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein that belongs to the EcoL15 ribosomal protein family.

The protein functions as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor. Upon binding the hormone ligand, the receptor dissociates from accessory proteins, translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes, and then stimulates transcription of androgen responsive genes. This gene contains 2 polymorphic trinucleotide repeat segments that encode polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts in the N-terminal transactivation domain of its protein. Expansion of the polyglutamine tract causes spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease).

RGS proteins are able to deactivate G protein subunits of the Gi alpha, Go alpha and Gq alpha subtypes. They drive G proteins into their inactive GDP-bound forms. Regulator of G protein signaling 10 belongs to this family. All RGS proteins share a conserved 120-amino acid sequence termed the RGS domain. This protein associates specifically with the activated forms of the two related G-protein subunits, G-alphai3 and G-alphaz but fails to interact with the structurally and functionally distinct G-alpha subunits. Regulator of G protein signaling 10 protein is localized in the nucleus.	molecular function|signal transducer activity|IEA|GO:0004871|GOA|na//biological process|signal transduction|IEA|GO:0007165|GOA|na		inhibits signal transduction by increasing the gtpase activity of g protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into their inactive gdp-bound form. associates specifically with the activated forms of the g protein subunits g(i)-alpha and g(z)- alpha but fails to interact with the structurally and functionally distinct g(s)-alpha subunit. activity on g(z)-alpha is inhibited by palmitoylation of the g-protein.

Inhibin has been shown to regulate gonadal stromal cell proliferation negatively and to have tumour-suppressor activity.  In addition, serum levels of inhibin have been shown to reflect the size of granulosa-cell tumors and can therefore be used as a marker for primary as well as recurrent disease.   Because expression in gonadal and various extragonadal tissues may vary severalfold in a tissue-specific fashion, it is proposed that inhibin may be both a growth/differentiation factor and a hormone.  Furthermore, the beta B subunit forms a homodimer, activin B, and also joins with the beta A subunit to form a heterodimer, activin AB, both of which stimulate FSH secretion.	biological process|cell differentiation|NAS|GO:0030154|GOA|10320815//biological process|cell growth and/or maintenance|IEA|GO:0008151|GOA|na//biological process|cell-cell signaling|NR|GO:0007267|GOA|na//molecular function|cytokine activity|TAS|GO:0005125|		inhibins and activins inhibit and activate, respectively, the secretion of follitropin by the pituitary gland. inhibins/activins are involved in regulating a number of diverse functions such as hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion, gonadal hormone secretion, germ cell development and maturation, erythroid differentiation, insulin secretion, nerve cell survival, embryonic axial development or bone growth, depending on their subunit composition. inhibins appear to oppose the functions of activins.

They include 3 highly homologous subtypes: alpha2A, alpha2B, and alpha2C. These receptors have a critical role in regulating neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system. The mouse studies revealed that both the alpha2A and alpha2C subtypes were required for normal presynaptic control of transmitter release from sympathetic nerves in the heart and from central noradrenergic neurons. The alpha2A subtype inhibited transmitter release at high stimulation frequencies, whereas the alpha2C subtype modulated neurotransmission at lower levels of nerve activity. This gene encodes the alpha2C subtype, which contains no introns in either its coding or untranslated sequences.	biological process|G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway|TAS|GO:0007186|GOA|9371698//biological process|activation of MAPK|TAS|GO:0000187|GOA|10196213//molecular function|adrenoceptor activity|IEA|GO:0004935|GOA|na//molecular function|alpha2-adrenergic receptor activity|TAS|GO:0004938|GOA|9371698//biological process|behavior|NR|GO:0007610|GOA|na//biological process|cell-cell signaling|TAS|GO:0007267|GOA|9371698//cellular component|endosome|TAS|GO:0005768|GOA|10196213//cellular component|integral to plasma membrane|TAS|GO:0005887|GOA|9371698//molecular function|rhodopsin-like receptor activity|IEA|GO:0001584|GOA|na		alpha-2 adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine- induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase through the action of g proteins.	integral membrane protein.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Sequence analysis identified three alternatively spliced variants that encode distinct isoforms.	cellular component|intracellular|IEA|GO:0005622|GOA|na//cellular component|mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit|NAS|GO:0005762|GOA|11279069//cellular component|mitochondrion|IEA|GO:0005739|GOA|na//biological process|protein biosynthesis|IEA|GO:0006412|GOA|11279069//biological process|protein biosynthesis|NAS|GO:0006412|GOA|11279069//cellular component|ribosome|IEA|GO:0005840|GOA|na//molecular function|structural constituent of ribosome|IEA|GO:0003735|GOA|11279069//molecular function|structural constituent of ribosome|NAS|GO:0003735|GOA|11279069			mitochondrial.

The calpain proteins are heterodimers consisting of an invariant small subunit and variable large subunits. The large subunit possesses a cysteine protease domain, and both subunits possess calcium-binding domains. Calpains have been implicated in neurodegenerative processes, as their activation can be triggered by calcium influx and oxidative stress. The protein encoded by this gene is highly expressed in the placenta. Its C-terminal region lacks any homology to the calmodulin-like domain of other calpains. It also lacks critical active site residues and thus is suggested to be proteolytically inactive.	molecular function|calpain activity|TAS|GO:0004198|GOA|9503024//cellular component|intracellular|IEA|GO:0005622|GOA|na//biological process|proteolysis and peptidolysis|IEA|GO:0006508|GOA|na		not known; does not seem to have protease activity as it has lost the active site residues.

Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, usually lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) in animal cells, and his-asp-glu-leu (HDEL) in S. cerevisiae.  This process is mediated by a receptor that recognizes, and binds the tetrapeptide-containing protein, and returns it to the ER.  In yeast, the sorting receptor encoded by a single gene, ERD2, is a seven-transmembrane protein.  Unlike yeast, several human homologs of the ERD2 gene, constituting the KDEL receptor gene family, have been described. KDELR2 was the second member of the family to be identified, and it encodes a protein which is 83% identical to the KDELR1 gene product.	cellular component|Golgi apparatus|TAS|GO:0005794|GOA|1316805//molecular function|KDEL sequence binding|TAS|GO:0005046|GOA|1316805//cellular component|endoplasmic reticulum|TAS|GO:0005783|GOA|1316805//cellular component|integral to membrane|TAS|GO:0016021|GOA|1325562//biological process|intracellular protein transport|TAS|GO:0006886|GOA|1325562//molecular function|receptor activity|IEA|GO:0004872|GOA|na		required for the retention of luminal endoplasmic reticulum proteins. determines the specificity of the luminal er protein retention system. also required for normal vesicular traffic through the golgi. this receptor recognizes k-d-e-l.	integral membrane protein.

Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L13P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyA signals have been observed. This gene is co-transcribed with the small nucleolar RNA genes U32, U33, U34, and U35, which are located in its second, fourth, fifth, and sixth introns, respectively. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.	cellular component|intracellular|IEA|GO:0005622|GOA|na//cellular component|large ribosomal subunit|TAS|GO:0015934|GOA|10580157//biological process|protein biosynthesis|IEA|GO:0006412|GOA|na//molecular function|structural constituent of ribosome|TAS|GO:0003735|GOA|10580157
