Summary 
Background Genome-wide measures of gene expression can identify patterns of gene activity that subclassify 
tumours and might provide a better means than is currently available for individual risk assessment in patients 
with lymph-node-negative breast cancer. 

Methods We analysed, with Affymetrix Human U133a GeneChips, the expression of 22 000 transcripts from total 
RNA of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic 
treatment. 

Findings In a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients 
positive for oestrogen receptors (ER) and 16 genes for ER-negative patients. This signature showed 93% sensitivity 
and 48% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. The gene profile 
was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5·67 
[95% CI 2·59–12·4]), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5·55 
[2·46–12·5]). The 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in 
the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9·60 [2·28–40·5]), 87 postmenopausal patients (4·04 [1·57–10·4]), 
and 79 patients with tumours of 10–20 mm (14·1 [3·34–59·2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of 
prognosis is especially difficult. 

Interpretation The identified signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients at high risk of distant 
recurrence. The ability to identify patients who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent 
confirmation, allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less aggressive therapeutic options.

ER status was used to identify subgroups. Each subgroup was then analysed 
separately for selection of markers. The patients in a subgroup were assigned to 
a training set or a testing set. The markers selected from each subgroup were 
combined to form a single signature to predict tumour recurrence for all patients 
in the testing set as a whole. The left panel of the clustering analysis is a view of 
the 17 819 informative genes. Red indicates high relative expression, green 
relative low expression. Each column is a sample and each row is a gene. The 
right panel shows enlarged views of two dominant gene clusters that had drastic 
differential expression between the two subgroups of patients. The upper gene 
cluster has a group of 282 downregulated genes in the ER-positive subgroup, 
and the lower gene cluster is represented by a group of 339 upregulated genes 
in the ER-positive subgroup. The label bar at the foot of each dendrogram 
indicates the patient’s ER status measured by routine assays. 

radiotherapy has no clear effect on distant disease 
recurrence.22 Lymph-node negativity was based on 
pathological examination by regional pathologists.23 All 
286 tumour samples were confirmed to have sufficient 
(70%) tumour and uniform involvement of tumour 
in 5 µm frozen sections stained with haematoxylin and 
eosin. Amounts of oestrogen receptors (ER) and 
progesterone receptors (PR) were measured by ligand-
binding assay, EIA,24 or immunohistochemistry (nine 
tumours). The cut-off value for classification of patients 
as positive or negative for ER and PR was 10 fmol per 

mg protein or 10% positive tumour cells. Postoperative 
follow-up involved examinations every 3 months for 
2 years, every 6 months for years 3–5, and every 
12 months from year 5. The date of diagnosis of 
metastasis was defined as that at confirmation of 
metastasis after symptoms reported by the patient, 
detection of clinical signs, or at regular follow-up. 

Gene-expression analysis 

Total RNA was isolated from 20–40 cryostat sections of 
30 µm thickness (50–100 mg) with RNAzol B (Campro 
Scientific, Veenendaal, Netherlands). Biotinylated 
targets were prepared by published methods 
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA)25 and hybridised to 
the Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray U133a 
GeneChip. Arrays were scanned by standard 
Affymetrix protocols. Each probe set was treated as a 
separate gene. Expression values were calculated by use 
of Affymetrix GeneChip analysis software MAS 5.0. 
Chips with average intensity of less than 40 or 
background signal of more than 100 were rejected. For 
chip normalisation, probe sets were scaled to a target 
intensity of 600, and scale mask files were not selected. 

Statistical methods 

17 819 genes were “present” in two or more samples and 
were eligible for hierarchical clustering. Before 
clustering, the expression level of each gene was divided 
by its median expression level in the patients. This 
standardisation step limited the effect of the magnitude 
of expression of genes, and grouped together genes with 
similar patterns of expression in the clustering analysis. 
To identify subgroups of patients, we carried out average 
linkage hierarchical clustering on both the genes and the 
samples using GeneSpring 6.0. To identify genes that 
discriminated patients who developed distant 
metastases from those remaining metastasis-free for 
5 years, we used two supervised class prediction 
approaches. In the first approach, 286 patients were 
randomly assigned to training and testing sets of 80 and 
206 patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves26 
for the two sets were examined to ensure that there was 
no significant difference and that no bias was introduced

by the random selection of the training and testing sets. 
In the second approach, patients were allocated to one of 
two subgroups stratified by ER status (figure 1). Each 
subgroup was analysed separately for selection of 
markers. Patients in the ER-positive subgroup were 
randomly allocated into training and testing sets of 
80 and 129 patients, respectively. The ER-negative 
subgroup was randomly divided into training and 
testing sets of 35 and 42 patients, respectively. Markers 
selected from each subgroup training set were combined 
to form a single signature to predict tumour metastasis 
for both ER-positive and ER-negative patients in a 
subsequent independent validation. 

The sample size of the training set was determined by 
a resampling method to ensure its statistical confidence 
level. Briefly, the number of patients in the training set 
started at 15 patients and was increased in steps of five. 
For a given sample size, ten training sets with randomly 
selected patients were made. A gene signature was 
constructed from each of the training sets and tested in a 
designated testing set of patients by analysis of the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with 
distant metastasis within 5 years as the defining point. 
The mean and the coefficient of variation of the area 
under the curve (AUC) for a given sample size were 
calculated. A minimum number of patients required for 
the training set was chosen at the point at which the 
average AUC reached a plateau and the coefficient of 
variation of the ten AUC was less than 5%. 

Genes were selected as follows. First, univariate Cox’s 
proportional-hazards regression was used to identify 
genes for which expression (on a log2 scale) was 
correlated with the length of distant-metastasis-free 
survival. To reduce the effect of multiple testing and to 
test the robustness of the selected genes, the Cox’s 
model was constructed with bootstrapping of the 
patients in the training set.27 Briefly, 400 bootstrap 
samples of the training set were constructed, each with 
80 patients randomly chosen with replacement. A Cox’s 
model was run on each of the bootstrap samples. A 
bootstrap score was created for each gene by removing 
the top and bottom 5% p values and averaging the 
inverses of the remaining bootstrap p values. This score 
was used to rank the genes. To construct a multiple 
gene signature, combinations of gene markers were 
tested by adding one gene at a time according to the 
rank order. ROC analysis with distant metastasis within 
5 years as the defining point was done to calculate the 
AUC for each signature with increasing number of 
genes until a maximum AUC value was reached. 

The relapse score was used to calculate each patient’s 
risk of distant metastasis (panel). The score was 
defined as the linear combination of weighted 
expression signals with the standardised Cox’s 
regression coefficient as the weight. 

highest specificity. Values of constants A of 313·5 and 
B of 280 were chosen to centre the threshold of relapse 
score to zero for both ER-positive and ER-negative 
patients. Patients with positive or negative relapse 
scores were classified as those with poor or good 
prognosis, respectively. The gene signature and the 
cut-off were validated in the testing set. Kaplan-Meier 
survival plots and log-rank tests were used to assess the 
differences in time to distant metastasis of the 
predicted high-risk and low-risk groups. Odds ratios 
were calculated as the ratio of the odds of 
distant metastasis between the patients predicted to 
experience relapse and those predicted to remain 
relapse free. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox’s 
proportional-hazards regression were done on the 
individual clinical variables with and without the gene 
signature. The hazard ratio and its 95% CI were derived 
from these results. Statistical analyses used S-Plus 
software (version 6.1). 
Pathway analysis 
A functional class was assigned to each prognostic 
signature gene. Pathway analysis was done with 
Ingenuity software (version 1.0). Affymetrix probes 
were used as input to search for biological networks 
built by the software. Biological networks identified by

Role of the funding sources 

This study was supported partly by the Dutch Cancer 
Society and the Netherlands Genomics Initiative/ 
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research. 
These organisations had no role in study design; the 
collection, analysis, or interpretation of data; writing of 
the paper; or in decisions relating to publication. The 
Erasmus Medical Centre was financially supported by 
Veridex LLC, a Johnson & Johnson Company, for tissue 
processing and isolating RNA for Affymetrix chip 
analysis. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and took final responsibility for 
the decision to submit the paper for publication. 

Results 

The median follow-up for the 198 patients who 
survived was 101 months (range 20–171). Of the 

286 patients included, 93 (33%) showed evidence of 
distant metastasis within 5 years and were counted as 
failures in analysis of distant-metastasis-free survival. 
Five (2%) patients died without evidence of disease and 
were censored at last follow-up. 83 (29%) died after 
previous relapse. Therefore, 88 patients (31%) were 
failures in the analysis of overall survival. 

Clinical and pathological features of 286 patients are 
summarised in table 1. There were no differences 
among the groups in age or menopausal status. The 
ER-negative training group had a slightly higher 
proportion of larger tumours and, as expected, more 
poor-grade tumours than the ER-positive training 
group. The validation group of 171 patients (129 ER-
positive, 42 ER-negative) did not differ from the total 
group of 286 patients in any of the characteristics of 
patients or tumours. 

Two approaches were used to identify markers 
predictive of disease relapse. First, we randomly 
divided all the 286 patients (ER-positive and ER-
negative combined) into a training set and a testing set. 
35 genes were selected from 80 patients in the training

distant metastasis was built. Moderate prognostic value 
was observed (data not shown). Unsupervised 
clustering analysis showed two distinct subgroups 
highly correlated with the tumour ER status (2 test, 
p0·0001; figure 1), which supported our second 
approach in which patients were first grouped on the 
basis of ER status. Each subgroup was analysed for 
selection of markers. 76 genes were selected from 
patients in the training sets (60 for the ER-positive 
group, 16 for the ER-negative group; figure 2). With the 
selected genes and ER status taken together, a Cox’s 

model to predict recurrence of cancer was built for 
all lymph-node-negative patients. Validation of the 
76-gene predictor in the testing set of 171 patients 
produced an ROC with an AUC of 0·694, sensitivity of 
93% (52/56), and specificity of 48% (55/115; figure 2).

(95% CI 4·04–35·1; p0·0001) to develop distant 
metastasis within 5 years. As the control, randomly 
selected 76-gene sets were generated. These produced 
ROC with an average AUC value of 0·515, sensitivity of 
91%, and specificity of 12% in the testing group.

Patients stratified by such a gene set would have an 
odds ratio of 1·3 (0·50–3·90; p=0·8) for development 
of metastases, indicating a random classification. In 
addition, the Kaplan-Meier analyses for distantmetastasis-
free and overall survival as a function of the 
76-gene signature showed highly significant 
differences in time to metastasis between the groups 
predicted to have good and poor prognosis (figure 2). At 
60 months and 80 months, the respective absolute 
differences in distant-metastasis-free survival between 
the groups with predicited good and poor prognosis 
were 40% (93% vs 53%) and 39% (88% vs 49%), and 
those in overall survival were 27% (97% vs 70%) and 
32% (95% vs 63%) respectively. 

The 76-gene profile also represented a strong 
prognostic factor for the development of distant 
metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal 
patients (hazard ratio 9·60), 87 postmenopausal 
patients (4·04), and 79 patients with tumour sizes of 
10–20 mm (14·1; figure 3). 

Univariate and multivariate Cox’s regression analyses 
are summarised in table 2. Other than the 76-gene 
signature, only grade was significant in univariate 
analyses and moderate/good differentiation was 
associated with favourable distant-metastasis-free 
survival. Multivariate regression estimation of hazard 
ratio for the occurrence of tumour metastasis within 
5 years was 5·55 (p0·0001), indicating that the 
76-gene set represents an independent prognostic 
signature strongly associated with a higher risk of 
tumour metastasis. Univariate and multivariate 
analyses were also done separately for ER-positive 
and ER-negative patients; the 76-gene signature 
was also an independent prognostic variable in 
the subgroups stratified by ER status (data not 
shown). 

The function of the 76 genes (table 3) in the 
prognostic signature was analysed to relate the genes to 
biological pathways. Although 18 of the 76 genes have 
unknown function, several pathways or biochemical 

activities were identified that were well represented, 
such as cell death, cell cycle and proliferation, DNA 
replication and repair, and immune response (table 4). 
Genes implicated in disease progression were found, 
including calpain2, origin recognition protein, dual-
specificity phosphatases, Rho-GDP dissociation 
inhibitor, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily 
protein, complement component 3, microtubule-
associated protein, protein phosphatase 1, and 
apoptosis regulator BCL-G. Furthermore, previously 
characterised prognostic genes such as cyclin E228 and 
CD4429 were in the gene signature. 

The dataset has been submitted to the NCBI/ 
Genbank GEO database (series entry GSE2034). 

Discussion 

We provide results of an analysis of primary tumours 
from 286 patients with lymph-node-negative breast 
cancer of all age-groups and tumour sizes. The patients 
had not received adjuvant systemic therapy, so the 
multigene assessment of prognosis was not subject to 
potentially confounding contributions by predictive 
factors related to systemic treatment. 

The study revealed a 76-gene signature that accurately 
predicts distant tumour recurrence. This signature could 
be applied to all lymph-node-negative patients 
independently of age, tumour size and grade, and ER 
status. In Cox’s multivariate analysis for distantmetastasis-
free survival, the 76-gene signature was the 
only significant variable, superseding clinical variables, 
including grade. After 5 years, absolute differences in 
distant-metastasis-free and overall survival between the 
patients with the good and poor 76-gene signatures were 
40% and 27%, respectively. Of the patients with good-
prognosis signatures, 7% developed distant metastases 
and 3% died within 5 years. If further validated, this 
signature will yield a positive predictive value of 37% and 
a negative predictive value of 95%, on the assumption of 
a 25% rate of disease recurrence in lymph-node-negative 
patients. In particular, this signature could be valuable 
for defining the risk of recurrence for the increasing 
proportion of T1 tumours (2 cm). Comparison with 
the St Gallen and National Institutes of Health 
guidelines was instructive. Although ensuring that the 
same number of high-risk patients would receive the 
necessary treatment, our 76-gene signature would 
recommend systemic adjuvant chemotherapy to only 
52% of low-risk patients, compared with 90% and 89% 
by the St Gallen and National Institutes of Health 
guidelines (table 5). Our gene signature, if further 
confirmed, could result in a reduction of the number of 
low-risk lymph-node-negative patients who would be 
recommended to have unnecessary adjuvant systemic 
therapy (table 5). 

The 76 genes in our prognostic signature belong to 
many functional classes, which suggests that different 
paths could lead to disease progression. The signature

Table 3: 76 genes from the prognostic signature 

included well-characterised genes and 18 unknown 
genes. This finding could explain the superior 
performance of this signature compared with other 
prognostic factors. Although genes involved in cell 
death, cell proliferation, and transcriptional regulation 
were found in both groups of patients stratified by ER 
status, the 60 genes selected for the ER-positive group 
and the 16 selected for the ER-negative group had no 
overlap. This result supports the idea that the extent of 
heterogeneity and the underlying mechanisms for 
disease progression could differ for the two ER-based 
subgroups of breast-cancer patients. 

Comparison of our results with those of Van de Vijver 
and colleagues12 is difficult because of differences in 
patients, techniques, and materials used. Their study 
included node-negative and node-positive patients, who 
had or had not received adjuvant systemic therapy, and 
only women younger than 53 years. Furthermore, the 
microarray platforms used in the studies differ— 
Affymetrix and Agilent. Of the 70 genes in the study by 
van‘t Veer and co-workers,11 48 are present on the 
Affymetrix U133a array, whereas only 38 of our 76 genes 
are present on the Agilent array. There is a three-gene

overlap between the two signatures (cyclin E2, origin

Despite the apparent difference, both signatures included 
genes that identified several common pathways that might 
be involved in tumour recurrence. This finding supports 
the idea that although there might be redundancy in gene 
members, effective signatures could be required to 
include representation of specific pathways. 

The strengths of our study compared with the study of 
Van de Vijver and colleagues12 are the larger number of 
untreated lymph-node-negative patients (286 vs 141), and 
the independence of our 76-gene signature with respect

validation set of patients is completely without overlap

In conclusion, since only 30–40% of untreated lymphnode-
negative patients develop tumour recurrence, our 
prognostic signature could provide a powerful tool to 
identify those patients at low risk preventing 
overtreatment in substantial numbers of patients. If 
confirmed in subsequent studies, the recommendation 
of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with lymphnode-
negative primary breast cancer could be guided by 
this prognostic signature. The predictive value of our 
gene signature with respect to the efficacy of different 
modes of systemic therapy could be tested in the adjuvant 
setting or in patients with metastatic disease.
