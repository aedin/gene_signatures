CDC45L	required to the initiation of DNA replication
MAD2L1	is a component of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate p31(comet, formerly known as Cmt2) counteracts the function of Mad2 and is required for the silencing of the spindle checkpoint12 reconstitution of Mad2 in Brca1deficient cells partially restored the spindle checkpoint13 binds directly to CDC2014
ESPL1	is required for sister chromatid separation during mitosis in human cells 15
CCNB2	is a member of the cyclin family and its overexpression results in CIN16
FEN1	causes repeat instability and aberrant DNA repair
TTK	is required for centrosome duplication and for the normal progression of mitosis17 is a critical regulator of genetic stability, it is required for the spindle assembly checkpoint18
CCT5
RFC4	Mutation in this replication factor leads to aberrant checkpoint control in response to damage to chromosomes19 or DNA damage.
