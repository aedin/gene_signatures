UniGene ID	Gene name	Gene Symbol	Known function(s)	Fold change
Hs.244613	Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b	STAT5b	Signal transducer of IL-2, IL-4, CSF1, and different growth hormones. Important for TCR signaling, apoptosis, adult mammary gland development, and sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression	-4.2
Hs.239138	Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor	PBEF	A cytokine that increases the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in fetal membrane and may be important in both normal spontaneous labor and infection-induced preterm labor	2.2
Hs.158315	Interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein	IL18RAP	An accessory subunit of the heterodimeric receptor for IL-18 enhances the IL-18 binding a ligand binding subunit of IL-18 receptor. The coexpression of IL-18R1 and this protein is required for the activation of NF-?B and MAPK8 (JNK) in response to IL-18	3
Hs.76090	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 1 (endothelial)	TNFaIP1	Unknown	2.3
Hs.225948	Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 27	CCL27	Cytokine that plays a role in mediatinghoming of lymphocytes to cutaneous sites. It specifically binds to chemokine receptor 10 (CCR10). Studies of murine protein indicate that these protein-receptor interactions have a pivotal role in T-cell-mediated skin inflammation	-2.5
Hs.301921	C-C chemokine receptor type 1	C-C CKR1	Cytokine receptor important for host protection from inflammatory response and susceptibility to virus and parasite	-2.7
Hs.57735	Scavenger receptor class F, member 1	SCARF1	Scavenger receptor that has roles in the binding and degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein and may be involved in atherosclerosis	-2.2
Hs.4930	Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4	LRP4	A membrane protein which may be involved in calcium ion binding	-2.8
