miR-7	"Expressed in pancreatic adult and fetal endocrine cells [18,19,30]"
miR-375	Negative regulator of glucose-induced insulin secretion through myothrophin regulation [15]. miR-375 K/O mice are hyperglycemic -more alpha cells; less beta-cells- [17]. Regulation of PI3 pathway by regulation of PDK1 in insulinoma cells [31]. The miR-375 gene promoter directs expression selectively to endocrine pancreas [32].
miR-9	Expressed at high levels during islet development [19]. Target of transcription factor Onecut-2 impairing glucose-induced insulin secretion in insulinoma cells.
miR-195; miR-16 miR-15a; miR-15b	"Role in pancreatic regeneration, possibly by targeting Ngn3 [22]."
miR-124a	"Regulation of insulin secretion machinery and transcription factor Foxa2 in insulinoma cells [21,33]."
miR-218	"Expressed in mouse early fetal pancreas, controls the liver and pancreatic development regulator Onecut-2 in liver embryonic cells [34]."
miR-484; miR-107; miR-30d	High glucose down-regulates their expression in insulinoma cells [35].
miR-146a	"Increased expression in islets from db/db obese mice, contributes to fatty acids-induced beta-cell dysfunction [36]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce its expression in human islet and MIN6 cells [37]."
miR-29a	Over-expression induced insulin resistance in 3T3 adipocytes [38].
miR-503	miR-503 is expressed in a pattern similar to that of miR-375 in a mouse progenitor cells at e14.5 pancreas [13].
miR-376a	Expressed at high levels during islet development [19].
miR-21; miR-34a	Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce its expression in human islet and MIN6 cells [37]. miR-34a also contributes to fatty acids-induced beta-cell dysfunction [36].
miR-96	"Increases mRNA and protein levels of granulophilin, a negative regulator of insulin exocytosis [33]."
